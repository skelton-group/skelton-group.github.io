### Dr Jonathan Skelton (PI)
-----------

<div class="bio verbose">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-JonathanSkelton.jpg" alt="Jonathan Skelton" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>Jonathan joined the University of Manchester in 2018 on a Presidential Fellowship and was currnetly holds a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship.</p>
    <p>
      He is interested in using modelling to understand how materials with unusual properties "work", which has a habit of leading to large and/or challenging calculations.
      He is also interested in spectroscopy and occasionally helps experimental collaborators with measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonathan's teaching includes courses on functional molecular materials, phonon theory and applications, and physical chemistry.
      He also helps design and run computational "experiments" for the 3<sup>rd</sup>-year undergraduate Chemistry labs.
    </p>  
    <p>On the (currently rare) occasions when he is not buried in research and teaching, Jonathan also enjoys cooking, photography and gardening.</p>

### Joseph (Joe) Flitcroft (PDRA)
----------

<div class="bio">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-JosephFlitcroft.jpg" alt="Joe Flitcroft" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>
      Joe is a PDRA in computational materials chemistry.
      He obtained a 2.1 degree in Chemistry at the University of Bath, UK (2013) before continuing to a PhD in computational chemistry, also at the University of Bath (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
      He has completed several postdoctoral research positions on hybrid thermometric materials, ceria-based "nanozymes" and graphene-based phosphate sensors.
      He is currently researching chalcogenide and skutterudite-based thermoelectric materials.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of research, Joe is a keen athlete, specialising in hammer throwing.</p>

### Ioanna Pallikara (PhD student)
----------

<div class="bio">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-IoannaPallikara.jpg" alt="Ioanna Pallikara" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>
      Ioanna completed her undergraduate studies at The University of Manchester.
      Her 4<sup>th</sup>-year MChem project involved using atomistic molecular dynamic simulations for the structural determination of giant supramolecular assemblies, under the supervision of Dr Neil Burton.
    </p>
    <p>Her PhD project is focused on using high-throughput quasi-harmonic lattice-dynamics calculations to set up a database of calculated elastic and thermal properties of materials, which will be used to search for new structure-property relationships.</p>
    <p>
      Her interests include playing the piano, singing and baking.
      She is also an active member and social secretary of the UoM A Cappella and Beatboxing Society.

### Matt Brown (PhD student)
----------

<div class="bio">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-MattBrown.jpg" alt="Matt Brown" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>Matt completed his M. Chem. degree at the University of Southampton in 2019.</p>
    <p>He is now working with the Skelton and Popelier groups on protocols for matching periodic density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with Interacting Quantum Atoms calculations to identify key interactions in molecular solids and understand the energy differences between polymorphs.</p>
    <p>Outside of chemistry, Matt likes to read fantasy books, baking and running.</p>

### Sophie Guilemot (MChem student)
----------

<div class="bio">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-SophieGuillemot.jpg" alt="Sophie Guillemot" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>Sophie is a 4<sup>th</sup>-year M. Chem. student at Manchester.</p>
    <p>
      She enjoys learning about materials, their properties and how to design materials for specific functions.
      This is her first time working outside of the lab on a computational project - a new and challenging development!
    </p>
    <p>Outside of her studies, her favourite activities are reading and trying out new cuisines.</p>

### Ben Asher (MChem student)
----------

<div class="bio">
  <img src="/assets/images/People-BenAsher.jpg" alt="Ben Asher" class="headshot">
  <span>
    <p>Ben joined the group as a Masters' student in September 2020, in the final year of his four-year undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester.</p>
    <p>
      His third year was spent out on industrial placement at Scapa UK Ltd., where he worked on designing sub-sea power cables.
      His Masters' project is on how materials change with temperature, and using modelling to calculate and analyse the thermal properties.
    </p>
    <p>In his spare time, Ben enjoys watching and playing sport, spending time with friends and hiking.</p>
