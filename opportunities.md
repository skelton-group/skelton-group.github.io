Funded positions in the group will be listed on this page as they become available.

There are a number of schemes available to support PhD and post-doctoral studies in Manchester and the UK, so if you think you would like to work with us, but don't see any suitable positions advertised here, please [get in touch](./contact.html).

We are also happy to take informal questions about Masters' projects and summer projects - again, please [contact us](./contact.html) if you are interested in working in the group.

### PhD studentship: Understanding and controlling polymorphism in molecular solids
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A fully-funded PhD studentship is available to work with the Skelton and Popelier groups at Manchester on the topic of understanding polymorphism in molecular solids.

The aim of the project is to develop a protocol for combining insight from periodic density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and quantum-chemical topology (QCT) methods, such as the modern Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) scheme, to explore the chemical origins of polymorphism in molecular solids.
If successful, the protocol will then be used to develop machine learning models, trained on information from QCT calculations, to automatically derive high-quality, bespoke force fields with DFT-level accuracy for tackling problems such as surface chemistry and crystal growth/dissolution.

We aim to start the project in September 2020, and funding is available for 3.5 years.
Due to funding restrictions, this studentship is open to UK and EU applicants only.

Further details and links to the application form are available from [FindAPhD.com](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/understanding-and-controlling-polymorphism-in-molecular-solids/?p117811).
Informal inquiries about the position and project are welcome.
