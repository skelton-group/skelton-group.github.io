## Welcome to the Skelton research group website

We are a theory group based in the School of Chemistry at the University of Manchester, UK.

We use a wide variety of theoretical modelling techniques to study a materials ranging from inorganic semiconductors to molecular crystals and "hybrid" inorganic/organic systems.
We are particularly interested in modelling and understanding structural dynamics in solids and their effect on material properties.

Atomistic modelling is one of the most important tools in modern Materials Science.
High-level theoretical calculations using for example density-functional theory (DFT) are now routinely applied to help interpret and explain experimental results.
More recently, the predictive power of DFT combined with high-performance computing (HPC) has made it feasible to design and discover materials *in silico*, providing researchers with new approaches to challenges such as sustainable ("green") energy.

Standard atomistic modelling studies athermal (*T* = 0 K) structures where the atoms are assumed to be "frozen" to their crystallographic positions.
This static works well for a number of problems, but it is a significant approximation.

Even at 0 K, zero-point vibrational motion adds to the thermodynamic free energy, and the subtle changes can be enough to stabilise one material phase over another.
At non-zero temperatures, thermal expansion of the crystal lattice leads to progressive changes in structural, mechanical, electrical and optical properties, and is a particularly important consideration when materials are used in high-temperature applications.
In some material systems, complex "anharmonic" structural dynamics lead to very different properties to the average crystallographic structure and novel effects such as heavily-suppressed thermal conductivity.

        Coupling between the motion of the PbI<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cage and the MA<sup>+</sup> cation suppresses the thermal conductivity and is likely to be an important contributor to its excellent performance as a photovoltaic (PV) absorber.

The theory of lattice dynamics provides an efficient and straightforward framework for including dynamics in theoretical models.
However, the computing power needed to perform lattice-dynamics calculations routinely and on complex systems is a recent development, so they are presently very under-exploited.

Our research focusses on three key applications of lattice dynamics in materials modelling:

* Using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to model the temperature dependence of material properties
* Easy-to-use codes for simulating vibrational spectra (e.g. infrared, Raman)
* Methods to study anharmonic systems, including studying thermal transport and systems with dynamical instabilities ("soft" phonon modes)

We apply theoretical modelling techniques to a wide range of systems and problems, and we regularly work with experimental groups to validate our results and to help get the most insight from measurements.
